    </h3>
    <p>
      Discy mission is to share and grow the world’s knowledge. A vast amount of
      the knowledge that would be valuable to many people is currently only
      available to a few — either locked in people’s heads, or only accessible
      to select groups. We want to connect the people who have knowledge to the
      people who need it, to bring together people with different perspectives
      so they can understand each other better, and to empower everyone to share
      their knowledge for the benefit of the rest of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The potential of this is huge. If we can execute on our mission, we’re
      going to make a big impact on the world. We just need to get a smart group
      of people together that can get us there.
